The objective of the project is to deliver an efficient Courier Management System whose main functionality apart from calculating the courier Bill includes predicting the time required to reach the destination. As per our client requirement, our main object should be managing consignment in an effective manner.The system will be used for day-to-day activities like out return, company details, hub rates, booking, non-delivery, and pickup centers. It is not easy to do this process manually because it would become very hectic. Hence it is suggested to automate the process by developing the relevant software as the world is moving from manual working to an information and technology era where automation becomes important in all parts of life.

The main purpose of this system is to connect all branches to the central database so the everywhere information is the same. This system increases efficiency and increases the customer satisfaction level.
